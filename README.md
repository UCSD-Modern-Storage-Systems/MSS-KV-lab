# Project overview
This project aims to build a fast, scalable, and crash-consistent key-value store
on persistent memory (we name it as PMKV) using the open-source Persistent Memory Developement Kit
([PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk/)) library.
The purpose of this project is to get you familiar with how to program your own
data structure on persistent memory.  In doing so, you will learn a number of key concepts
about persistent memory programming and how to apply them in your code by using PMDK library.

Your task is to implement all of the following interfaces using PMDK.  Although PMDK
consists of multiple libraries, you will only need to use **libpmemobj** that supports
building a transactional object store on a persistent memory file.  Since it is written in C,
your implementation needs to be written in C as well.  The following interface is defined in
include/pmkv.h.

```
typedef struct {} pmkv;

pmkv* pmkv_open(const char *path, size_t pool_size, int recover);
void pmkv_close(pmkv *kv);
int pmkv_get(pmkv *kv, const char *key, size_t key_size, char *out_val, size_t *out_val_size);
int pmkv_put(pmkv *kv, const char *key, size_t key_size, const char *val, size_t val_size);
int pmkv_delete(pmkv *kv, const char *key, size_t key_size);
int pmkv_count_all(pmkv *kv, size_t *out_cnt);
int pmkv_exists(pmkv *kv, const char *key, size_t key_size);
```

`pmkv_open` should create a pool at `path` with the size `pool_size`. When `recover` is 0,
it should create a new pool. When `recover` is 1, it should start from an existing pool
at `path`. Specifying `recover` to 1 means the recovery of your PMKV.

`pmkv_get` searches a value using a key specified by `key` and `key_size`. `key` indicates
the start memory address where your key resides and `key_size` indicates the byte size of the key.
`out_val` and `out_val_size` returns the pointer to the value and the byte size of the value, respectively.
On success, `pmkv_get` should return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

`pmkv_put` inserts or updates a new key-value pair. Specifying key and value is similar to `pmkv_get`.
On success, `pmkv_put` should return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

`pmkv_delete` deletes an entry specified the key. On success, it should return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

`pmkv_count_all` counts the number of all entires in your PMKV. `out_cnt` returns the pointer
to the count value. On success, it should return 0. Otherwise, return 1.

`pmkv_exists` checks if a give key-value pair exists. Return 1 if exists, 0 otherwise.

Once your implementation of PMKV is completed, it will be evaluated in three categories:

- Functional correctness
- Crash-consistency
- Performance

The first part of the project is to make your PMKV functionally correct.
This means the basic operations such as `pmkv_get`, `pmkv_put`, and `pmkv_delete` operate correctly.  Our test harness
will test them with various workloads.  You should also implement `pmkv_count_all` and `pmkv_exists` for
your PMKV to pass our test cases.

The second part of the project is to make your PMKV crash-consistent.
Being crash-consistent means that your PMKV should always be in a consistent state after recovery.
Our test harness will test this by randomly crashing your program and trying recovery several times.  We will
repeat this long enough until we find any inconsistent state of your program.

The last part of the project is to optimize the performance of your PMKV.


As a reference, we provide an example implementation that uses [PMEMKV](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv).
PMEMKV provides multiple types of engines that conform to the same common API.  Provided engines are
either volatile or persistent and vary in supporting concurrent access and sorting.  By default,
we use `cmap`, a volatile, concurrent hash map, as reference.  You can find the code in `src/pmemkv.c`.


## Getting started
For this project, we prepared a Docker image that contains all prerequisites, so the only thing you need to do
is to build and run the Docker image.  Install Docker by downloading it from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

There are a number of files and directories in this repository.  Here is a brief overview.
- At the top level, Makefile and Dockerfile help you build and run the docker image that you will use for the project.  Makefile.docker
will be copied as Makefile into the project home directory in your docker container.
- `example` contains various PMDK examples that you will find helpful to understand the library better.
- `include` contains the `pmkv.h` header file that defines the PMKV interfaces you need to implement.
- `src` contains the `pmkv.c` source file that will hold your implementation.  You need to add your implementation to this file. 
`src` also contains a PMEMKV reference implementation in `pmemkv.c`.
- `test` contains the test harness.
- `bench` contains the performance benchmark.

## Running the Docker image
First, build the docker image by doing the following:
```
$ make image
``` 
This may take for a while.  If you have many cores in your machine and want to speed up the build,
you can change the value of `build_core` in the Dockerfile.  The default is using 8 cores.

Once the image is built, you can run the docker container out of the image by doing the following:
```
$ make run
```
This will place you in the home directory of your project in the Docker container.

By default, we use `/mnt/ramdisk` directory as the mount point in the container.  This is mounted using the `data` directory
in your project repository on the host machine.  The files that our test script and benchmark use will use this directory.

## PMDK examples
To help you better understand PMDK (and libpmemobj in particular), we provide example codes in `example` directory.
You can build and run them by doing the following:
```
$ cd example
$ make <target_example_name>
$ ./bin/<target_example_name> <args>
```
For those who are not familiar with how to use PMDK, we highly recommend you to try these examples first.  Play enough with
these examples to get confidence before jumping into the actual PMKV implementation! 

## Building PMKV
Once you are done with your own implementation, you can build it as follows:
```
$ cd src
$ make
```
This will generate a static library named `libpmkv.a` in `src` directory. This library is the core output that will be used for testing and benchmarking later on.

If you want to test the reference implementation based on PMEMKV, build it as follows:
```
$ cd src
$ make PMEMKV=1
```
This will generate the `libpmkv.a` using the PMEMKV implementation. Since PMEMKV is already a stable implementation, it will completely pass
all the test cases in `test` directory.  You can also check how it performs in `bench` directory.

## Testing
Testing PMKV involves two steps.

The first is `basic_test` that tests the functional correctness of your PMKV implementation.
The largest test case creates 2 GB of pool and inserts and searches 4 million key-value pairs.
`basic_test` currently consists of 24 test cases in total, but may be added with more test cases.

To run the `basic_test`, do the following:
```
$ cd test
$ make clean
$ make
$ ./bin/basic_test
```

The second is `recovery_test` that tests the crash-consitency of your PMKV implementation.
It is still under development. You will be notified once it's ready.

## Measuring performance
Once you make sure that your PMKV implementation becomes stable enough (e.g. after passing the testing above),
you can measure its performance under `bench` directory.  We adopted the benchmark from [pmemkv-tools](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv-tools),
which contains additional tools and benchmarks for testing PMEMKV.  Running the benchmark is similar, but you
don't need to specify `--engine` parameter since the default is your PMKV.

To run the benchmark, do the following:
```
$ cd bench
$ make clean
$ make
$ ./bin/bench --db=<path_to_your_pool_file> --db_size_in_gb=<integer> ...
```

By default, the db path is `/mnt/ramdisk/bench` and the db size is 1GB.

Supported parameters
```
--db=<location>            (path to persistent pool, default: /dev/shm/pmemkv)
                           (note: file on DAX filesystem, DAX device, or poolset file)
--db_size_in_gb=<integer>  (size of persistent pool to create in GB, default: 0)
                           (note: always use 0 with poolset or device DAX configs)
--histogram=<0|1>          (show histograms when reporting latencies)
--num=<integer>            (number of keys to place in database, default: 1000000)
--reads=<integer>          (number of read operations, default: 1000000)
--threads=<integer>        (number of concurrent threads, default: 1)

    fillrandom             (load N values in random key order)
    overwrite              (replace N values in random key order)
    readseq                (read N values in sequential key order)
    readrandom             (read N values in random key order)
    readmissing            (read N missing values in random key order)
    deleteseq              (delete N values in sequential key order)
    deleterandom           (delete N values in random key order)
    readwhilewriting       (1 writer, N threads doing random reads)
    readrandomwriterandom  (N threads doing random-read, random-write)
```

## Submission
You will turn in your submission in Gradescope. You have to submit all the source files that need to build your library (a.k.a. libpmkv.a).
If you need to add new source files other than pmkv.c, you might need to change the Makefile as well.  In such cases, don't forget to submit
your modified Makefile along with the new source files.  If we cannot compile your code and produce the libpmkv.a, we cannot grade your PMKV.

It will be auto-graded and you should have your grade and some feedback in a few minutes.

You are allowed to submit as many times as you want until the deadline.

You should also submit a writeup about how you designed and implemented your PMKV at the end of the project.

**All assignments will be announced via Piazza**.
